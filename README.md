# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

A **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that analyzes movie reviews to determine sentiment (positive/negative). The pipeline includes **data scraping, preprocessing, translation, feature extraction, and machine learning models** to classify reviews.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Automated Data Collection** – Scrapes and processes movie reviews from the web  
✅ **Ukrainian Language Support** – Translates English reviews for consistency  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF vectorization  
✅ **Balanced Dataset** – Ensures unbiased sentiment classification  
✅ **Machine Learning Models** – Implements **Linear SVC & Logistic Regression**  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Insights into preprocessing steps and model performance  
✅ **User Interface** – Simple UI for testing sentiment predictions

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Scrape & preprocess movie reviews** (clean, translate, tokenize)  
2. **Extract features** using **TF-IDF vectorization**  
3. **Train models** (Linear SVC, Logistic Regression) on a balanced dataset  
4. **Evaluate performance** with visualization tools  
5. **Test predictions** using a simple UI
